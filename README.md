## Features

1. **Third-Party Authentication**  
   Uses [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for secure authentication with trusted Google services.

2. **Data Storage**  
   Stores data in a relational format using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), a reliable and scalable service.

3. **Scalability**  
   Both **Auth0** and **Supabase** are designed for scalability, ensuring efficient handling of increased traffic.

4. **Column Validation (C3 & C4)**  
   - Invalid data types for mathematical operations are flagged by the backend.
   - Empty (NaN) rows are automatically ignored.
   - Missing columns (C3 or C4) trigger an error and notify the user.

5. **Docker Integration**  
   Uses a **Dockerfile** to consolidate dependencies, simplifying deployment and enabling scalable containerization for high traffic.
